      {
        "question": "Can it be financed?",
        "answer": "Yes. It's possible to finance the installation with convenient payment plans. If you're interested, ask us about our financing system and the options that best suit your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do installations have a warranty?",
        "answer": "Yes. Geesol works with top manufacturers who offer: 12, 15, or 25 years product warranty (solar panel); 25 or 30 years performance warranty (solar panel); 10 years warranty for HUAWEI inverters; 25 years for ENPHASE microinverters; and 3 years installation warranty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does it work?",
        "answer": "Panels capture sunlight and convert it into electricity for immediate use at the property. What isn't consumed is fed back to the grid or stored in batteries. Installations generally include panels and an inverter. Batteries can be added optionally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do solar panels work on cloudy days?",
        "answer": "Yes. On cloudy days panels still produce electricity, generating around 10%–15% of their usual output. Excessive heat can also reduce output (power starts to decrease if panels exceed 25°C)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens with the energy I'm missing?",
        "answer": "In principle, the home is supplied by the photovoltaic system; if more is needed, the difference is covered by the grid. Consumption can be monitored at all times through an app (available on desktop and mobile)."
      },
      {
        "question": "And what about the energy I have left over?",
        "answer": "The system feeds surplus back into the grid. That energy is sold at wholesale price; it is not given away for free. According to Royal Decree 244/2019, this was regularized on August 5, 2019. More information here."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does installation take from the time I sign?",
        "answer": "It depends on the size of the project. For businesses, it can take 20–30 days; for homes, you can have your photovoltaic installation in 7–10 days. This timeframe depends on material availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it possible to install in apartment communities?",
        "answer": "Yes. Shared self-consumption is already allowed. It doesn't have to be for all neighbors; it can be associated with selected meters and even different allocation coefficients for each neighbor/partner. More information here."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there subsidies?",
        "answer": "Yes. At Geesol we can prepare all the documentation you need."
      },
      {
        "question": "If I already have solar panels for hot water, can I use them to generate electricity?",
        "answer": "No. Panels and installations are completely different because their uses are very different (plumbing is not the same as electricity)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you provide after-sales service?",
        "answer": "Yes. Professional service is our hallmark both before and after installation. Our clients' satisfaction is our main goal, and today we can proudly say we have a 100% satisfied client base. Many clients even request our annual maintenance service. Here we give you some tips to choose the right company."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between grid-connected self-consumption and off-grid self-consumption?",
        "answer": "The first is an installation that also has access to the general grid (typically homes within a population center), while off-grid installations have no physical connection to the grid (usually located in rural or agricultural areas). More information here."
